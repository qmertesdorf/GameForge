description: Use when giving a playable Godot game a coherent, prompt-derived audio identity — event SFX plus a looping music track — generated locally via ComfyUI + Stable Audio Open through tools/comfy.mjs. Derives an audio system from the concept, maps core-loop events to SFX, generates clips, wires AudioStreamPlayer nodes, records audio_pass, and advances status to "scored". Hands off to validator.

# Audio re-skin (local generative SFX + music)

Give a `playable`-or-better game an audio identity. Audio is orthogonal to the visual pass: a game may be `playable`, `styled`, or `scored` going in. The terminal status is `scored`; the `audio_pass` block — not the status string — is the source of truth for what was produced.

**Failure attribution (the POC value, same as `asset`):** a bad or absent clip is always attributable — a wrong event→SFX map, an unwired `AudioStreamPlayer`/signal, a clip that ignores `concept.theme`, or an *infra* failure in `comfy.mjs` (ComfyUI down) — never an unattributable gap. Each is a specific, fixable prose/recipe cause.

## Inputs
- `manifests/<id>.json` with a populated `concept` block (and `concept.theme`); game status is `playable`, `styled`, or `scored`.
- The game on disk at `games/<id>/`.
- ComfyUI reachable with Stable Audio Open installed: `node tools/comfy.mjs --check`. A failure here is *infra*, attributable to the stack — **stop** and ask the owner to start ComfyUI; never fake a clip.

## Outputs
- `games/<id>/audio/*.wav` — one committed clip per recipe (event SFX + a looping music track).
- Added `AudioStreamPlayer` nodes (+ their `*.wav.import` sidecars) wired to the mapped events.
- A populated `audio_pass` block and terminal `status = "scored"` (after step 6).

## Hard requirements
- **Game logic is untouched** — core loop, existing signals, and `selftest.gd` (if present) behave exactly as before. Audio only *adds* `AudioStreamPlayer` nodes + `play()` calls at existing signal points; it must not restructure the loop or break the self-test (the validator re-enforces this, Method 4).
- **Run `--import` after generating clips, before re-validation** (step 5b) — without the `.wav.import` sidecars the validator's headless run can't load the streams.
- **No new tool or dependency** — clips come from `tools/comfy.mjs`; wiring is plain GDScript/scene edits.
- **Do not** edit `concept`/`builder`/`asset`. Consume `concept.theme` as-is (reading it is not editing it).

## 1. Derive the audio system (do this first, once)
Read **`concept.theme`** — the title's modality-neutral world (premise/tone/mood_keywords/setting) — as the primary anchor, with `concept.genre` for form. The audio identity expresses the *same theme* the visuals do, sonically. Author a shared `audio_system`:
- `model`: `"stable-audio-open-1.0"`.
- `mood_prompt`: one shared mood sentence threaded into every clip prompt for coherence (the audio analog of the visual prompt scaffold), derived from `concept.theme`'s `tone` + `mood_keywords` — e.g. for a "cozy autumn-woodland" theme, "warm, organic, gentle woodland atmosphere".
- `style_descriptors`: 2–4 tags drawn from / consistent with `concept.theme.mood_keywords` (e.g. a "cozy/organic/storybook" theme → `["ambient", "soft", "acoustic"]`; a "retro/hard-edged/arcade" theme → `["chiptune", "8-bit", "upbeat"]`).
- `sonic_character`: the **SFX sound-material/timbre vocabulary** derived from `concept.theme` — the audio sibling of the visual world bible, and the thing that keeps SFX *on theme* instead of defaulting to generic explosive transients. Name the materials and timbre: a cozy/organic theme → "soft organic wooden/leaf/cloth taps, gentle, no electronic transients"; a retro/arcade theme → "crisp 8-bit square/triangle-wave blips, clean chip transients". Recorded verbatim in `audio_pass.audio_system.sonic_character`. **`mood_prompt`/`style_descriptors` steer the music mood; `sonic_character` governs the SFX** — both are required.

## 2. Map core-loop events to SFX
From `concept.core_loop` + the entity/signal set, list the discrete events that deserve a one-shot: typically a positive beat (collect/score), a negative beat (hurt/hit), a loss beat (game over), and the primary action (jump/hop/shoot). For each, record an `events[]` entry: `{ event, clip, node, signal }` where `node` is the `AudioStreamPlayer` you will add and `signal` is the Godot signal (or call site) that triggers it. Be honest: if an event has no SFX, leave it out and note it.

## 3. Author recipes
One recipe per SFX + one music recipe. Each prompt = `mood_prompt` + the clip-specific description. Defaults confirmed at the feasibility gate (`docs/superpowers/m1.6-feasibility-notes.md`):
- **SFX**: `kind:"sfx"`, `format:"wav"`, `duration_s` **1.0–2.0** (`EmptyLatentAudio` enforces a 1.0 s minimum — do not go below), `loop:false`, `steps` ~8, `cfg` ~5–6. Each SFX prompt = `mood_prompt` + **`sonic_character`** + the clip-specific event description. The *envelope* is theme-neutral — **short, single-shot** (~1–2 s) — but the **timbre/material MUST come from `sonic_character`**: do **not** default to a punchy/explosive transient. An aggressive/electronic/explosive SFX character that ignores `sonic_character` is the **finding-#3 failure** (the same explosive palette was wrong for *both* a cozy-woodland and a bright-arcade theme) and is attributable to this step. The negative prompt always excludes "music, melody, voice, speech", **plus a theme-aware exclusion**: a cozy/organic theme adds "explosion, harsh, distortion, aggressive, electronic"; an arcade theme keeps chip transients but still excludes "explosion, noise burst". (cfg too high can clip the transient.)
- **Music**: `kind:"music"`, `format:"wav"`, `duration_s` 20–40, `steps` ~50, `cfg` ~7, `loop:true`, `import_settings:{loop:true, loop_offset:0}`. Target loop-friendly content (steady texture, no hard intro/outro) — seamless looping is imperfect for generative output (known limitation). Note: WAV music is uncompressed (~5 MB / 30 s stereo); acceptable for a milestone, OGG is a future size optimization.
- All recipes use `sampler:"dpmpp_3m_sde_gpu"` (scheduler `exponential` is baked into the template).
- **IP-safety**: never name artists or copyrighted tracks; negative prompt excludes "voice, speech, lyrics, vocals" for music unless intended. Document this in `notes`.

## 4. Generate each clip
`node tools/comfy.mjs gen-audio <id> <clip-name> '<recipe-json>'` → writes `games/<id>/audio/<name>.wav`. The file is canonical and committed; the recipe is provenance, not bit-exact (GPU/seed nondeterminism). Requires Stable Audio Open installed + the `save_audio` soundfile-WAV patch (see the feasibility notes — output is WAV regardless of any `format` field, on the pinned torch 2.11/cu128 stack).

## 5. Wire into the Godot scene
- Add one `AudioStreamPlayer` per SFX (named per the `events[]` `node`) and one for music.
- Set import flags: music stream `loop = true` (and `loop_offset` if needed); SFX one-shot.
- **Music — start it so it actually plays.** Set **`autoplay = true` on the music `AudioStreamPlayer` *before* `add_child`**, or call `play()` **deferred/awaited a frame after** `add_child` (`await get_tree().process_frame` then `play()`, or `call_deferred("play")`). An immediate in-`_ready` `play()` called the **same frame** as `add_child` does **not** reliably start the stream — this is the confirmed **finding-#4 bug** (`MusicAmbient.playing=false, pos=0` after 90 frames); SFX escaped it only because they fire later in gameplay.
- **Levels:** set the music `volume_db` deliberately so the bed is **audible but sits under** the SFX — do not bury it (the proof bed was mixed ~13 dB under SFX *and* not playing). Balance the two.
- SFX: `play()` from the mapped `signal`/call site, replayable (call `play()` each event; for rapid repeats consider a small pool or `AudioStreamPlayer` per channel).
- Keep wiring minimal and reuse the game's existing signal points; do not restructure the core loop.

## 5b. Import the clips (before re-validation)
Run the headless import pass so Godot makes each `.wav.import` sidecar + cached stream **before** the validator's headless run (the audio analog of the `asset` method's `--import` gotcha):
```
godot --headless --path games/<id>/ --import
```
Commit the generated `*.wav.import` sidecars alongside the clips (expected Godot output, like `.png.import`).

## 6. Record `audio_pass` and advance status
Merge an `audio_pass` block (`method:"audio"`, `audio_system` — including `sonic_character` — `recipes`, `events`, `notes`) via the manifest tool, then `node tools/manifest.mjs set-status <id> scored`. State plainly in `notes` what was produced and anything skipped (mixed honesty). (`method:"audio"` is a constant provenance tag — the block name already says it's audio — **not** a branch key; unlike `asset_pass.method` (`svg`/`raster`), no consumer reads it.)

## 7. Hand off to validator
Run the validator's audio method to confirm files import, players reference valid streams, and SFX fire on events — **and that the music bed is actually playing.** Confirm `MusicAmbient.playing == true` with an advancing `get_playback_position()` a few frames in, not merely that the node exists and is wired (a wired bed can still be silent — that is exactly the finding-#4 bug, caught by this probe).
